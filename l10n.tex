\note{HM. A theme…? But HOW CAN WE DO IT?}

\takahashi{A Problem}

\takahashi{\includegraphics{piechart.pdf}}
\note{ca.~6\% of the world is a native speaker of English}

\takahashi{\includegraphics{piechart-2.pdf}}
\note{an additional 11\% can speak English as a second or third language}

\takahashi{\stack{Which\\languages?}}

\takahashi{\includegraphics{analytics.png}}
\note{do your market research… every business is different. if you're looking at GA, maybe like sum \texttt{en-us} and \texttt{en-ca}.}

\takahashi{\includegraphics{desktop-lang-picker.png}}
\note{like, supporting all the same languages as on dweb is not a \textit{terrible} choice. japanese launched recently; korean coming soon(ish).}

\begin{frame}%
\note{note that Japan is 25x the population of Ireland but has historically had less Meetup usage. registrations on Android among users in Japan went up a little bit when we launched translation beg of Sept but only shot up when we launched platformwide and made a real effort the end of the month}%

\takahashi{HOWTO}

\takahashi{\includegraphics{strings-xml.png}}
\note{\begin{itemize}
\item translate all the strings.
\item fortunately, it's pretty easy on Android. like, I looked at Phil's slides on iOS localizations and it's maybe a three-step process with at-signs or something? not for us.
\item put all the strings to be translated in \texttt{strings.xml}.
\item like, actually, \textbf{all} of them. (much easier to get it right the 1st time than fix it later)
\item don't put all the strings not to be translated there.
\end{itemize}}

\note<2>{it's really hard to expect to rely on crowdsourcing for languages your app isn't yet popular in. maybe twitter can get away with it, but you probably can't. and contract translators may be okay but won't know and love your product, nor can they be expected to use consistent terminology.}%
\note<3>{so like obviously whatever you can do is what you should do. can you open an office in every country in which you do business? can you buy your friend a beer to fix the most egregious errors in third-party translations?}}

\takahashi{\includegraphics{phraseapp.png}}

\takahashi{\texttt{libcore.icu.ICU}}
\note{hidden, private internal API. but maybe for some things you want to call it by reflection anyway. you'll need a fallback though for platforms where it's unavailable. some useful stuff like words for ``yesterday'' and ``today'', and slightly lower-level date formatting.}
